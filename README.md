## Requirements

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Installation

Install all dependencies:

    npm install

## Development

Start the application:

    NODE_ENV=development npm start

Then, open the application in your browser at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

## Testing

Karma & Jest unit and (Jest) integration test

```
NODE_ENV=development npm test
```

Only Karma unit tests

```
NODE_ENV=development npm run test-karma
```

Only Jest unit tests

```
NODE_ENV=development npm run test-jest
```

Integration tests

```
NODE_ENV=development npm run test-integration
```

### E2E testing

End to end test can either run against a local server or through docker-compose.

In order to test authentication the following environment variables must be set:

- `PASSWORD_EMPLOYEE`
- `PASSWORD_EMPLOYEE_PLUS`
- `USERNAME_EMPLOYEE`
- `USERNAME_EMPLOYEE_PLUS`

They can simply be added by using the `export` command from the command line, or by adding these
variables to `.bash_profile`.

### E2E testing

Make sure the app is running locally by running `npm start`.
Then, in a second terminal, run `npm run test-e2e` (single run).
Or open the UI using `npm run test-e2e-watch`.

Test using docker-compose:
```
docker-compose up --build test-e2e
```

To test against production APIs you can use the same tasks, suffixed with `prod`:

- Make sure the app is running locally by running `npm run start-prod`.
- Then, in a second terminal, run `npm run test-e2e-prod` (single run).
- Or open the UI using `npm run test-e2e-prod-watch`.

### E2E Aria testing

Make sure the app is running locally.
Then run `npm run test-aria`.

Test using docker-compose:
```
docker-compose up --build test-e2e-aria
```
