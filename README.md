## Requirements

- [NodeJS > 8.x.x](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Installation

Install all dependencies:

    npm i -g yarn
    yarn

## Development

Start the application:

    yarn start

Then, open the application in your browser at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

## Testing

Karma & Jest unit and (Jest) integration test

```
NODE_ENV=development yarn test
```

Only Karma unit tests

```
NODE_ENV=development yarn test-karma
```

Only Jest unit tests

```
NODE_ENV=development yarn test-jest
```

Integration tests

```
NODE_ENV=development yarn test-integration
```

### E2E testing

End to end test can either run against a local server or through docker-compose.

In order to test authentication the following environment variables must be set:

- `PASSWORD_EMPLOYEE`
- `PASSWORD_EMPLOYEE_PLUS`
- `USERNAME_EMPLOYEE`
- `USERNAME_EMPLOYEE_PLUS`

They can simply be added by using the `export` command from the command line, or by adding these
variables to `.bash_profile`.

Make sure the app is running locally by running `yarn start`.
Then, in a second terminal, go to `cd test/e2e` and run `yarn start` (single run).
Or open the UI using `yarn watch`.

Test using docker-compose:
```
docker-compose up --build test-e2e
```

To test against production APIs you can use the same tasks, suffixed with `prod`:

- Make sure the app is running locally by running `yarn start-prod`.
- Then, in a second terminal, run `yarn test-e2e-prod` (single run).
- Or open the UI using `yarn test-e2e-prod-watch`.

### E2E Aria testing

Make sure the app is running locally.
Then run `yarn test-aria`.

Test using docker-compose:
```
docker-compose up --build test-e2e-aria
```

## Known issues
- on windows there is a bug in sass-lint that prevents `yarn lint` to fail when there are linting errors.
  work-around: install sass-lint globally and run commands specified in the  `lint:style` script direct in a bash
  terminal
